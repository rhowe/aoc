# Advent of Code

This is somewhere to record my attempts at [Advent of
Code](https://www.adventofcode.com).

# 2022

2022 has also started with jsonnet, but we'll see if it stays that way.

# 2021

2021 was done using [jsonnet](https://www.jsonnet.org) which is a JSON
processing library spun out of Google.

It is not a particularly appropriate choice.

# 2020

I attempted 2020 using [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). It was very slow
and awkward and I didn't get much done.

# 2019

The first year I attempted AoC. My chosen tool: bash. It was a lot of fun,
especially optimising the IntCode interpreter.
